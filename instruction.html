<p> **Start the Game:**
   - Open a web browser on your computer or mobile device.
   - Search for "Play Pac-Man online" or visit a website that offers online Pac-Man games. There are several websites and emulators that allow you to play Pac-Man for free.</p>

<p> **Game Controls:**
   - On most websites or emulators, you can control Pac-Man using the arrow keys on your keyboard.
   - Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to navigate Pac-Man through the maze.</p>

<p> **Objective:**
   - The main objective is to eat all the dots (also known as pellets) in the maze.</p>
   - You can also eat larger, flashing dots called "Power Pellets" to turn the ghosts blue and temporarily make them vulnerable. Eating a blue ghost earns you extra points.</p>

<p> **Avoid the Ghosts:**
   - In the maze, you'll encounter colorful ghosts (Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde), which are your enemies.
   - Avoid the ghosts at all costs. If a ghost touches Pac-Man, you lose a life.</p>

<p> **Power Pellets:**
   - Eating a Power Pellet temporarily allows you to turn the tables on the ghosts. When they turn blue, you can eat them for extra points.
   - Be quick, as the ghosts will turn back to their normal colors after a short period.</p>

<p> **Eating Fruit:**
   - Periodically, fruit will appear in the maze for bonus points. Try to eat it when you can.</p.

<p> **Extra Lives and Levels:**
   - You usually start the game with multiple lives. Losing a life doesn't necessarily mean the game is over.
   - As you progress through levels, the game becomes faster and more challenging.</p>

<p> **High Score:**
   - The goal is to achieve a high score by eating as many dots, ghosts, and fruit as possible.</p>

<p> **Game Over:**
   - The game ends when you lose all your lives. At this point, you can usually restart the game if you want to play again.</p>

<p> **Enjoy and Repeat:**
    - Pac-Man is a classic and addictive game, so enjoy playing, challenge yourself to beat your high score, and have fun!</p>
